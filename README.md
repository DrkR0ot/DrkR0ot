# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
Hi!  
I'm **DrkR0ot**, an offensive cybersecurity enthusiast.  
I love exploring, learning, and sharing my knowledge in this fascinating field.  
My goal is to **help make the digital world safer and more reliable**, while helping others grow in this area.  
I started with training in Systems and Networks, then self-taught on **TryHackMe**, specializing in the **offensive side** of cybersecurity.  
Later, I turned to the more academic approach offered by Hack The Box, which I believe provides the most technical and comprehensive courses on the market (and as you’ll see below, I’m a big fan!).  
I've now spent **4 years** learning **self-taught** in my spare time, taking **Hack The Box** courses and **regularly completing their machines** (my username is [DrkR0ot](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/984954) there too).  
Today, I have obtained **several cybersecurity certifications**, which I completed in increasing order of difficulty, following my own path:
- Cisco Certified Network Associate Security (CCNA Security) from Cisco 
- Certified StormShield Network Administrator (CSNA) from StormShield
- Junior Penetration Tester (eJPTv2) from INE Security ([See my review](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregoire-durand-drkr0ot_cybersecurity-pentesting-redteam-activity-7020064853155282944-9wWQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACRK-8MBVF6Q2viJ1QWf5MWuQO-QGfp9r88))
- Virtual Hacking Labs Advanced Level (VHL) from VirtualHackingLab ([See my review](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregoire-durand-drkr0ot_certification-vhl-advanced-level-activity-7057730537964064768--2kU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACRK-8MBVF6Q2viJ1QWf5MWuQO-QGfp9r88))
- Virtual Hacking Labs Confirmed Level (VHL+) from VirtualHackingLab ([See my review](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregoire-durand-drkr0ot_certification-vhl-activity-7086330235389898752-KObW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACRK-8MBVF6Q2viJ1QWf5MWuQO-QGfp9r88))
